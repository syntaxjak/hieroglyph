# NINE

Simple terminal animation written in Rust that showers the terminal with randomly generated bytes and writes them out as a one-time pad.

## Run

```bash
cargo run --release                  # falls forever (Ctrl+C to stop); pad saved to pad.hex and pad.txt
cargo run --release -- -length 1024  # stop after writing 1024 pad bytes
```

The pad is written to `pad.hex` as hex pairs (32 bytes per line) and `pad.txt` as the visible byte glyphs you see in the animation. Use tools like `xxd -r -p pad.hex pad.bin` if you need raw binary output.

Use `Ctrl+C` to stop early if you do not want to watch the full loop.
